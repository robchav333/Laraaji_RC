        In the mid 2000s Kevin Morby left his native Kansas City for the vibrant streets of Brooklyn, initially making a name for himself as the bassist
        for noise folk stalwarts Woods and frontman of indie rock outfit The Babies. In 2013, Morby released his first solo album Harlem River, a departing
        love letter to the Big Apple that preceded a move to the bright lights of Los Angeles, a city that his since shaped the blossoming alternative indie
        sound of his subsequent albums.</span> </p>
      <p>The concert was alive and carried the spirit of the Morby's musical genius to a live audience. My second show at the fillmore but this show apart of many I have attended.
        It has been my new favorite musician and show I have seen live up to date. Discovering Kevin Morby a year ago was one of the best discoveries I have made. Go listen to the
        young legend on today's music platforms.</p>
